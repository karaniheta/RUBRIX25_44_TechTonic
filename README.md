# Anvaya - Food Rescue Platform  

## **Introduction**  
Anvaya is a platform built to address two critical global challenges: **food waste** and **hunger**. Every year, millions of tons of edible food are discarded, while millions of people face hunger and food insecurity. Anvaya bridges this gap by connecting food donors—restaurants, households, and suppliers—with recipients such as shelters, food banks, and community centers. By fostering collaboration and leveraging technology, Anvaya ensures that surplus food reaches those in need efficiently and sustainably.
